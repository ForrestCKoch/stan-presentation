## *Disclaimer*

I am by no means an expert in Bayesian Inference. I would describe myself
Bayesian "enthusiast" at best.

## Aims

- To encourage you to consider Bayesian approaches for your analyses.
- To put STAN on your radar as a flexible and powerful tool for Bayesian inference.
- Give an overview of how STAN works.
- Provide some examples of how it can be used.

## Overview

- Why Bayes?
- Why STAN?
- How does it work?
- Some Examples.

## The Canonical Formula

\begin{block}{Bayes Rule}
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$
\end{block}

## In practice

$$\underbrace{P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|x)}_{\text{posterior}}\propto \overbrace{\mathcal{L}(x|\boldsymbol{\theta})}^{\text{Likelihood}}\underbrace{P(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{prior}}$$

- $x$ is the observed data
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are the parameters of interest
- Note 1: $P(x)$ is not tractable, but it is constant
- Note 2: A uniform prior results in $P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|x)\propto \mathcal{L}(x|\boldsymbol{\theta})$

## Bayesian versus Frequentist

\begin{block}{Bayesian:}
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\text{MAP}}=\underset{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{argmax}}  \;P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|x)$$


\begin{itemize}
    \item The true parameter is treated as random.
    \item The estimate is chosen as the posterior mode.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Frequentist:}
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\text{MLE}}=\underset{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{argmax}} \;\mathcal{L}(x|\boldsymbol{\theta})$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item The true parameter is treated as constant.
    \item Estimate aims to maximize the probability of observing data.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


## Benefits of Bayes over Frequentist

- The ability to incorporate prior knowledge
- More interpretable
    - Credible intervals vs. confidence intervals
    - Estimation of probability of hypotheses
    - Resolves some of the limitations of p-values
- More flexible
    - Hierarchical models are more straightforward
    - Easier to take measurement uncertainty into account
    - Non-standard hypothesis testing by probing the posterior
    
## Drawbacks of the Bayes approach:

- Computationally complex \& demanding
- Prior specification is very important
    - Too strong of a prior can bias results
    - Can affect tractability (remedied by conjugate priors)
- Not what people are used to seeing
